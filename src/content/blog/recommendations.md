Here I have collected some awesome lists of projects I found very useful.
Please check yourself if you can use them in your own project.

# Art

These are nice artworks one can use.

Icons:

- **[Material](https://fonts.google.com/icons) by Google.** No introduction needed.
- **[Feather](https://feathericons.com/).** Very similar to the material icons, but a bit ... lighter.
- **[Breeze](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/breeze-icons) by KDE.** Hard edges, thin lines and very good-looking.
  Used around their desktop environment, so there are a lot of icons to choose from.

Illustrations:

- **[undraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations).** Nice corporate drawings free to use.
- **[Old book illustrations](https://www.oldbookillustrations.com/).** Title says it all: A collection of drawings
  found in books so old they are now royalty free.

Other stuff that doesn't really fit into these categories:

- **[KDE Connect.](https://kdeconnect.kde.org/)** Connects your phone with your pc to exchange notifications,

  Also adds media controls for the music and videos playing on your pc. Works for Linux, Windows and even MacOS.
