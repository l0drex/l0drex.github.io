Brings the default themes of the [KDE Plasma desktop environment](https://kde.org/de/plasma-desktop/) to Intellij IDEs.
The concept is simple, but it took quite some time to figure out the names of the UI components and
what color of the Breeze palette works best. All for the sake of having a consistent theme on my desktop.
