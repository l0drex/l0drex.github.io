Not a project that I started, but I made some contributions to fix and improve the existing code.
The idea is that, similar to Safari, Firefox changes its theme to match the 
[`theme-color` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta/name/theme-color) present
in the meta information of some websites.
