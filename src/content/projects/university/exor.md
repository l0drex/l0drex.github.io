We developed a 3D game in Unity where you can
walk around an operating room,
talk to the people working there,
see descriptions of various robots and devices
and play two minigames.

The project was developed in a team of 4 people using Unity and C# scripts.
We worked together with [6G life](https://6g-life.de/) and implemented their requirements.
We targeted pupils at an age of 8 to 12 years old.
The final piece would be a wall-mounted touch screen.

The exhibition piece will be part of the [MS Wissenschaft tour 2026](https://ms-wissenschaft.de/en/).
