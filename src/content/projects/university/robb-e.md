Robb-e is a robot seal that teaches students the concept of machine learning.
It teaches students how a computer would learn to differentiate different pictures of cats,
along with the difficulties this algorithm would have.

![An example level of robb-e. It asks the player to select the set of cat pictures that the machine would recognize.](@assets/projects/robb-e-2.png)

Players are asked questions that they answer by clicking on a button.
It's designed to be used on an interactive media table.
