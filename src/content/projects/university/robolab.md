In the second semester, we built a maze-solving LEGOâ„¢ robot.
It followed black lines on a paper sheet on the ground with intersection points in a grid.
The task was to build and program the whole robot from scratch.
During debugging, we were able to check our calculated position in the maze
with a server on the network.

My task was to develop the maze-solving algorithm using 
[Dijkstras Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) as well as establishing and managing
the connection and communication to the server.
