The famous [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) game implemented as a website.
The game can be played using mouse clicks and gestures. We also investigated implementing a Alexa Skill for voice input,
but weren't able to connect the skill with the page since there is no server for the website -
it all runs locally in the browser.
