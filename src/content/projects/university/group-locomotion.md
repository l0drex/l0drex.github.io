This is the project of my Bachelor thesis. I explored different techniques to move multiple people at once, 
who are all in a VR headset and in the same room.

There are a bunch of questions that had to be answered:

- How do we prevent people from running into each other?
- Who has control over the movement?
- How get others notified of a movement?
- What do we see of the real world?

I had a lot of fun doing it, and was able to deliver very good results.
