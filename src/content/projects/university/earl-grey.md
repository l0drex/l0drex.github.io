Earl Grey is a theater piece written by [Lars Engeln](https://www.lars-engeln.de/),
performed at the student theater [Die Bühne](https://die-buehne.tu-dresden.de/spielplan/earl-grey/) in Dresden.

For the performance, several students developed several different projects
using stage lights, VR headsets and projectors.
Our idea was to use particles to recreate different images, with the vision to recreate the effect of "finding a
memory".
The particle simulation would be shown behind the stage on a big projection screen and blend with the stage lighting.

Development was done in C++ and GLSL using the [Cinder](https://libcinder.org/) library.
