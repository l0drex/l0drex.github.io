In this project, we used augmented reality to teach students various geometric constructions.
These included finding the distance of a point and a line, and merging two geometric shapes.

Students work together simultaneously in a colocated environment.
They are connected over the network using RPC to see each other's work and receive feedback from the tutor.

A complex state machine guides the students through the different tasks.
The solutions are evaluated automatically and graded with points.

If a student should get stuck, the tutor is notified and can provide additional assistance.
