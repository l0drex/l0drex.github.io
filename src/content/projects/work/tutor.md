During the winter semesters, I work as a tutor for the IXLab at TU-Dresden as a tutor.
The work involves creating tutorials for the lecture "Foundations of Virtual Reality",
developing solutions for them and doing the tutorial sessions.

This work greatly improved my understanding of developing for virtual reality
and working in Unity.
It also trained my soft skills and troubleshooting skills.
