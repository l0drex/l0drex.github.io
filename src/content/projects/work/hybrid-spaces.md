Hybrid Spaces was an Augmented Reality exhibition in an abandoned cantine.
With a team of eight people with backgrounds in computer science, architecture and design,
we built a multisensory parkour that challenged the perception of reality.
Read more about this project [here](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/informatik/smt/im/forschung/projects/hybrid-spaces).
The foundation of it was [ViewR](https://github.com/ixlabTUD/ViewR), a framework for creating mixed reality experiences.

Personally, I had two major tasks in this project.
First, I built a system that would allow users to transition between different Unity scenes
without breaking the illusion of Augmented Reality. We achieved that by building a virtual elevator.
The second task was to build the backend for a booking system for tickets to the exhibition.
This was done using Python with Django.
