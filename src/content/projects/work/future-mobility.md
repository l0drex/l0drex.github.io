The [Chair of Industrial Design Engineering](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/maschinenwesen/imm/td?set_language=en)
developed a new traffic concept. We brought this concept into Virtual Reality, which enabled them to evaluate the
design while seeing a view of it in the context of a running city.

The project was also publicly shown during the [Dresdner Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften](https://www.wissenschaftsnacht-dresden.de/en/).

My part in this project was to program the movement of the car models. This was a quite complex task,
as the cable car modules had to be synced with the car modules. The foyer was also quite small, and adding multiple
cars made it quite crowded. Traffic lights had to be implemented as well, since cars shouldn't drive through each other.
